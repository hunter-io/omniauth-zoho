# OmniAuth Zoho

Zoho OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0 to access Zoho services such as ZohoCRM.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-zoho'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Zoho` is simply a Rack middleware. Read [the OmniAuth 1.0 docs](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) for detailed instructions.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :zoho, ENV['ZOHO_API_KEY'], ENV['ZOHO_SHARED_SECRET'], scope: 'ZohoCRM.modules.ALL'
end
```

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'zoho',
  :uid => '1234',
  :info => {
      :email => 'user@example.com', # email of zoho user
      :api_domain => 'https://accounts.zoho.com' # api domain for api requests
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'afasd923kjh0934kf', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you store and use to authenticate API requests
  }
}
```

## Multi DC

As of version 0.4.0, this gem supports Zoho's Mutli DC by returning the api_domain in the auth hash - see above for details.
